# User documentation

Unfortunately no user's guide currently exists for OpenRocket. Some documentation is available in the [OpenRocket wiki pages](http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/openrocket/), including a stub [User's guide](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/openrocket/index.php?title=User%27s_Guide) and a section of [frequently asked questions](https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/openrocket/index.php?title=FAQ).

If you would like to help, please extend the documentation!

## Technical documentation

OpenRocket was originally written as the Master's thesis of Sampo Niskanen at Helsinki University of Technology. This thesis is being extended and updated as the OpenRocket technical documentation. Below is the latest technical documentation and the original Master's thesis.
