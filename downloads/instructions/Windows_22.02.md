### Downloading the 22.02 Release

Download the Windows installer above for the <font color="red"><i>NEW</i></font> OpenRocket beta release, saying yes to whatever security prompts your browser presents. Then, double-click on or open the file to run the installer, much like other Windows installers.

While downloading the OpenRocket installer, you may see the following prompts:
<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
      <td>
        When you begin downloading the installer, this prompt may appear.  If you wish to continue with the download, <strong>left-click on "DOWNLOAD ANYWAY" to start the installer download</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/02.Download.02.01.Trusted_Warning.png" alt="Download Progress" width="240">

      </td>
      <td>
        Then, <em>Windows</em> wants you to be sure that you really want to keep the downloaded file. So, if you wish to keep the OpenRocket installer, then <strong>left-click the "Show more" option</strong>.
      </td>

### Installing the 22.02 Release

After the OpenRocket installer is downloaded, OpenRocket may be installed by doing the following:

<html>
  <table class="left" >
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Install_Windows_Prompt_01.png" alt="Install Prompt 1" width="240">
	  </td>
      <td>
	    <strong>Double-left-click on or open the installation file to run the installer</strong> (to start the <em>instal4j</em> installation wizard), displaying the progress of the installation wizard setup.
	  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Install_Windows_Prompt_02.png" alt="Make Changes Prompt" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
        After the wizard setup is complete, a warning screen will appear asking for your permission to allow this application to make changes to your device. To continue with the installation, <strong>left-click on the "Yes" button</strong>.
	</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Install_Windows_Prompt_03.png" alt="Welcome Screen" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
        The <em>Welcome</em> screen for the OpenRocket installation will then appear, giving you the option of choosing a different directory in which to save the OpenRocket files. <u>Unless you are familiar with directory structures</u>, you should <strong>leave "Yes..." selected and left-click the "Next" button</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
	    <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Install_Windows_Prompt_04.png" alt="File Extension Associations" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
        The next step is to set the file extension associations. The "OpenRocket Rocket Files (*ork)" box should already be checked, so, <u>unless you want to change the file associations</u>, you can just <strong>left-click the "Next" box</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Install_Windows_Prompt_05.png" alt="Progress bar" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
        As the OpenRocket application is installed, the installation progress is displayed.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Install_Windows_Prompt_06.png" alt="Finished" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
        After the installation has finished, the final prompt appears, stating that OpenRocket can be launched by selecting the installed icons. <strong>Left-click the "Finish" button</strong> to return to the <em>Desktop</em>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</html>

### After Installation Checks

*Contrary to what the installer states*, the 2022 Beta 2 installer **does not** provide a shortcut on the desktop, taskbar, or start menu. After running the installer, you may create a desktop shortcut by right-clicking on a blank area of the desktop, and then selecting **New &rarr; Shortcut** in the pop-up window. Within the *Create Shortcut* dialog box, on the *Browse* line, navigate to where the installer copied the files (typically "C:\Program&nbsp;Files\OpenRocket") and select "OpenRocket.exe" **NOT* "OpenRocket.jar", then **click "Okay" to move on**, <u>name the shortcut</u>, and **click "Finish"**.

<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/Windows_22.02.beta.02/Shortcut.Show-Exe.png" alt="Create Shortcut" width="240">
	  </td>
      <td>
	    To confirm the proper creation of the shortcut, left-click on the shortcut and select <em>Properties</em>. The shortcut tab should open, and <strong>MUST</strong> direct you to the OpenRocket.exe </em>Target</em> file, like this.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</html>

Alternatively, *if you are using Windows 11*, for easy access to OpenRocket in the future, after installing OpenRocket, navigate to the executable OpenRocket.exe file (usually located in the "C:\Program&nbsp;Files\OpenRocket” folder), then right click on the "OpenRocket.exe" file (NOT the “OpenRocket.jar” file), and create a shortcut, pin OpenRocket to the taskbar, and/or pin OpenRocket to the start menu, as you wish.
