### Downloading the 2022 Beta Release
Download the macOS installer above for the <font color="red"><i>NEW</i></font> OpenRocket beta release, saying yes to whatever security prompts your browser presents. Once the installer file is downloaded, follow the instructions below to install the OpenRocket application.

*NOTE: these instructions and screenshots are for macOS Monterey, but any recent-vintage macOS should behave similarly.*

### Installing the 2022 Beta Release
First, the .dmg installer file must be mounted. To do this, locate the downloaded file in Finder and double-click it or right-click it and select 'Open'. This will mount the image and pop up a window with the drag-and-drop installation window. Then follow the instructions below.

<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/01.Mounted_disk.gif" alt="Mounted installation disk image" width="320">
      </td>
      <td>
       After mounting the installation disk, you will be greeted with this window. To install OpenRocket just simply drag and drop the 'OpenRocket 22.02.beta.03' app on the left to the Applications folder to the right.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</html>

### First Launch of OpenRocket

Upon opening the OpenRocket application for the first time, you will get some security warnings. To let macOS know that OpenRocket is not a malicious software (trust us, it isn't), you will need to open it in a special way the first time. Normal ways of starting the application such as double clicking on it in Finder or launching it with Spotlight will not work for the first launch. To launch the application the first time, and tell macOS that you trust this application for future launches, follow this process:

<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/02.finder.png" alt="OpenRocket beta icon in finder window with options menu showing" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       Locate the OpenRocket application in Finder in the Applications directory. To open OpenRocket the first time <strong>right-click, control-click, or two finger click the application icon</strong> in Finder to get the options menu for it, then <strong>select "Open"</strong> from the menu.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/04.security_3.png" alt="security screen" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       <strong>Click the "Open" button in the security dialog</strong>. This will tell macOS you trust this application, from now on you can just launch OpenRocket like you would any other application.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</html>
