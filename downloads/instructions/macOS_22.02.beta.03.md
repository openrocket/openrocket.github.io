### Downloading the 2022 Beta Release

Download the macOS installer above for the <font color="red"><i>NEW</i></font> OpenRocket beta release, saying yes to whatever security prompts your browser presents. Once the file is downloaded, open it up either using the browser's "Open" function, or double-click it in the Finder. This will mount the image and open up a window with the drag-and-drop installation window. Then follow the instructions below.

*NOTE: these instructions and screenshots are for macOS Monterey, but any recent-vintage macOS should behave similarly.*

### Installing the 2022 Beta Release

<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/01.Mounted_disk.gif" alt="Mounted installation disk image" width="320">
      </td>
      <td>
       After mounting the installation disk, you will be greeted with this window. To install OpenRocket just simply drag and drop the 'OpenRocket 22.02.beta.02' app on the left to the Applications folder to the right. You're done!

### Dealing with OpenRocket app security warnings

Upon opening the OpenRocket application for the first time, you can get some security warnings. To let macOS know that OpenRocket is not a malicious software (trust us, it isn't), do the following:

<html>
  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/02.security_1.png" alt="Mounted installation disk image" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       If you get this pop-up, <strong>double-click the "OK" button</strong> in the security dialog.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/03.security_2.png" alt="Mounted installation disk image" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       Next, <strong>open System Preferences and select "Security & Privacy"</strong>, which will display the panel at left. <strong>At the bottom right, click the "Open Anyway" button</strong>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/04.security_3.png" alt="Mounted installation disk image" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       Finally, open the OpenRocket application again and <strong>click the "Open" button in the security dialog</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
