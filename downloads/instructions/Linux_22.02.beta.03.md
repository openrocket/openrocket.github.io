This process will have placed a number of files and directories in the
installation directory. Three that will be of the most use to you are

- **OpenRocket**\
  The OpenRocket executable.\
  You can run OpenRocket by giving the command\
  ```% ./OpenRocket```
  
- **OpenRocket 22.02.beta.02.desktop**\
  The OpenRocket desktop file.\
  As stated above, the installer isn't capable of actually creating the desktop icon at this time. You can create an OpenRocket desktop icon by copying this file to your desktop with\
  ```% cp 'OpenRocket 22.02.beta.03.desktop' ../Desktop```

- **uninstall**\
  The uninstaller.\
  You can uninstall OpenRocket with the command\
  ```% ./uninstall```\
  Unfortunately, the uninstaller does not fully empty and delete the installation directory.  To do this, give the commands\
  ```% cd ..```\
  ```% rm -r OpenRocket```

You will also be able to run OpenRocket from your desktop's menu.  It will appear in the "Other" software category.
