### Downloading the 2022 Beta Release

Download the macOS installer above for the <font color="red"><i>NEW</i></font> OpenRocket beta release, saying yes to whatever security prompts your browser presents. Once the file is downloaded, open it up either using the browser's "Open" function, or double-click it in the Finder. This will mount the image and open up a window with the drag-and-drop installation window. Then follow the instructions below.

*NOTE: these instructions and screenshots are for macOS Monterey, but any recent-vintage macOS should behave similarly.*

### First Launch of OpenRocket

Upon opening the OpenRocket application for the first time, you will get some security warnings. To let macOS know that OpenRocket is not a malicious software (trust us, it isn't), do the following the first time you open the application:

  <table class="left">
    <tr>
      <th>What you see</th>
      <th>What you do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/02.finder.png" alt="OpenRocket beta icon in finder window with options menu showing" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       To open OpenRocket the first time <strong>right-click, command-click, or two finger click the application icon</strong> in finder to get it's options menu, <strong>select "Open"</strong> from the menu.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="downloads/instructions/img/macOS_22.02.beta.02/04.security_3.png" alt="security screen" width="240">
      </td>
      <td>
       <strong>Click the "Open" button in the security dialog</strong>. This will tell macOS you trust this application, from now on you can just launch OpenRocket like you would any other application.
      </td>
    </tr>
